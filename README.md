# zillow
In this repo, I will be scraping data from Zillow based on city location and getting to see specific categories from the scrape. This scrape is useful to collect housing data. If this interests you, reach out to me because I have a more extensive private repository that I use to send reports to people who are interested in Real Estate investing.
